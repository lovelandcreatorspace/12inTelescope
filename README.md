#12" Telescope Resoration Project#
=============

##Restoration of Maurice's 12" German-Equatorial Newtonian Reflector telescope##

-------------

###Story:###
Finally, after far too long, I've started work on the 12" that Chris Austin gave me more than 4 years ago! If memory serves, the little that is known about the scope's origins is that it was taken from atop a hospital (in Germany, maybe?). Other than that, it's pretty old, rusty, beat to hell, heavy as I'll get out, and a beautiful piece of equipment!

Heartbreaking Disclaimer/Confession:
Unfortunately, when I first got the thing, I didn't think to take pictures of it (I'm not the biggest picture buff in the world). So, for the record, I apologize that this album begins half-way through day two... also, on transporting it up to Greeley from Woodland Park, I-25 claimed one of the tube covers as its own...scumbag I-25..

###More "technical" specs:###
-This is 12" in diameter (pretty darn big - lots of light can get in!), but here's something to give you an idea of how big some popular telescopes are!

-Newtonian reflector (class of telescopes invented by Sir Isaac Newton that uses two mirrors and an eyepiece)

-German Equatorial Mount (just the way the telescope moves/slews - it follows the stars with one motion)
