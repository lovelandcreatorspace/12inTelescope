#12" Telescope Resoration Project#
============
#####Restoration of Maurice's 12" German-Equatorial Newtonian Reflector telescope#####

###Story:###
-------------
Finally, after far too long, I've started work on the 12" that an old friend gave me more than 4 years ago! If memory serves, the little that is known about the scope's origins is that it was taken from atop a hospital (in Germany, maybe?). Other than that, it's pretty old, rusty, beat to hell, heavy as I'll get out, and a beautiful piece of equipment!

The telescope is a 12" diameter, german-equatorial mounted, newtonian reflector. There are no discernable manufacturing markings or brandings that I can find and there is no documentation to speak of. This project, hosted at Loveland CreatorSpace, will focus simply on getting the telescope put together and working once again. Repair or rusted hardware and repainting/sealing the scope will be a priority, followed by efforts to properly align the optics. Other action items include mounting casters to the base and finding a good way to store the tube safely.

Be sure to check out [Loveland CreatorSpace's Meetup Calendar](http://meetup.com/Loveland-CO-CreatorSpace/#calendar) for organized projet work days and, hopefully soon, astronomical observation nights! Also, be sure to check out other LCS member projects on [Github](http://github.com/lovelandcreatorspace)

###Heartbreaking Disclaimer/Confession:###
-------------
Unfortunately, when I first got the thing, I didn't think to take pictures of it (I'm not the biggest picture buff in the world). So, for the record, I apologize that the photos begin half-way through day two of restoration... also, on transporting it up to Greeley from Woodland Park, I-25 claimed one of the tube covers as its own...scumbag I-25...

This is 12" in diameter (pretty darn big - lots of light can get in!), but here's something to give you an idea of how big some popular telescopes are!
